# Send_Email_Using_Nodemailer
Simple and Mini Nodejs/Expressjs app using Nodemailer to send emails.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol(SMTP) info is required to work.

So, insert your own SMTP credentials in this project and send emails. You can prefer "https://www.mailgun.com/" to create account and set SMTP credentials.

At first just download the project and open it in any of the text editor like vs code.
Remember, you should have nodejs in your system. Otherwise, npm will not work.
In the terminal of the vs code, install all the dependencies into the environment one by one as follows:
   1. To install Expressjs type "npm install express" in the terminal.

   2. To install body-parser type "npm install body-parser" in the terminal.

   3. To install express-handlebars type "npm install express-handlebars" in the terminal.

   4. To install nodemailer type "npm install nodemailer" in the terminal.
   
After installing all the packages, don't forget to add SMTP credentials in the "app.js" file of the project.
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 . If all goes well then you will see
